# Notes


## helpful methods for itrations. 
`.lines()` to iterate over newlines in a string, can chain into `.map()`

`.split()` to split a string into a vector of substrings

`.take(n)` to get the first n values

`.filter_map()` acts like map, but the closure return Optionals, and None's are filtered out
